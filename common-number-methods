//WORKING WITH NUMBERS AND COMMON NUMBER METHODS -- July 22nd, 2025

---

//WHAT IS NaN AND HOW DOES isNaN WORK?
//The "isNaN()" function checks whether a value is NaN or not
//However, "Number.isNaN()" is a better way of checking this. It does not try to convert the object it is checking

---

//HOW DO THE PARSEFLOAT AND PARSEINT METHODS WORK
//These methods are great for user input or processing strings but needs to be treated as a numerical value
//Both of these methods ignore white space

//"parseFloat()" parses a string argument and returns a floating-point number
console.log(parseFloat("3.14")); //Output: 3.14
console.log(parseFloat("3.14 abc")); //Output: 3.14
console.log(parseFloat("3.14.5")); //Output: 3.14
console.log(parseFloat("abc 3.14")); //Output: NaN

//"parseInt()" parses a string argument and returns an integer
console.log(parseInt("42")); //Output: 42
console.log(parseInt("42px")); //Output: 42
console.log(parseInt("3.14")); //Output: 3
console.log(parseInt("abc123")); //Output: NaN

---

//WHAT IS THE "TOFIXED" METHOD AND HOW DOES IT WORK?
//"toFixed()" formats a number using fixed-point notation. This controls the decimal place. 
//This returns a string and not a number
//This rounds up by default
let price = 19.99;
let taxRate = 0.08;
let total = price + (price * taxRate);

console.log("Total: $" + total.toFixed(2)); //Output: "Total: $21.59"
