// UNDERSTANDING COMPARISONS AND CONDITIONALS
// In these lecture videos, you will learn about comparison operators and conditionals. You will learn how the various conditionals differ from one another, and how comparisons work with null and undefined.

---

//Undefined will mostly return false, but NaN is odd

---

//SWITCH STATEMENTS
//Without "default" the program will go through many more statements, which is something called "fall through"
//Switch statements use strict comparison (===)
switch (expression) {
  case value1:
    // code goes here
    break;
  case value2:
    // code goes here
    break;  
  case value3:
    // code goes here
  default:
    // code that executes if expression doesn't match any case
}
